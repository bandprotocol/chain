# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our network is a top priority. If you have discovered a security vulnerability within our repository, we appreciate your cooperation in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, we kindly ask that you email us directly at `security@bandprotocol.com`. We will review your report and may follow up to request additional information.

### What to Include

If possible, please provide as much of the following information as you can. This will help us understand the nature and scope of the potential issue:

- A clear and concise description of the potential vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof-of-concept (if possible).
- Any relevant tools, versions, or dependencies.
- Any possible mitigations or workarounds you have identified.


Thank you for helping keep our BandChain safe!
